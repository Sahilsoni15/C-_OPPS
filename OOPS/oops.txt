// OOPS- CLASSES AND OBJECTS

    // C++ --> initially called --> C with classes by strousstroup
    // class --> extension of structures in C
    // Structurs had limitations --> members are public
    //       --> members are public
    //       --> No methods

    // classes --> structers +more
    // classese --> can have methods and proerties
    // classes --> can make few members as private & few as public
    // structures in c++ are typedef
    // you can declare objects along with the class declaration like this:
    /* class Employee{
        //class defination
    } sahil,rohit,mayank; */
    // sahil.salary =8 makes no sense if salary is private
